# Bit Manipulation

This project focuses on practicing bitwise operations in C, including binary conversion, bit setting, clearing, and manipulation of individual bits. Each function follows the Betty coding style and uses only allowed standard functions (`malloc`, free, `exit`).

## Tasks Included
- Binary to unsigned int conversion
- Printing binary representation
- Bitwise operations like setting, clearing, and checking bits
